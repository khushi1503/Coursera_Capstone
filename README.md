# Coursera Capstone Project - Car Accident Severity

For the final capstone project in the IBM certificate course, we want to analyse the accident “severity” in terms of human fatality, traffic delay, property damage, or any other type of accident bad impact. Road traffic injuries are currently estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death across all age groups globally, and are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death by 2030.Analysing a significant range of factors, including weather conditions, special events, roadworks, traffic jams among others, an accurate prediction of the severity of the accidents can be performed.
The data was collected by Seattle SPOT Traffic Management Division and provided by Coursera via a link. This dataset is updated weekly and is from 2004 to present. It contains information such as severity code, address type, location, collision type, weather, road condition, speeding, among others.

The target audiences of this study are those people who really care about the traffic records, especially in the transportation department. Also, we want to figure out the reason for collisions and help to reduce accidents in the future.
